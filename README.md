## Quotex trading guide

Here is a more detailed guide to trading on Quotex:

### 1. Choosing an asset

The first step is to choose an asset to trade. Quotex offers a wide
range of assets, including currencies, commodities, and stocks. When
choosing an asset, it is important to consider the following factors:

-   **Volatility:** The volatility of an asset refers to how much its
    price fluctuates. More volatile assets offer greater potential for
    profit, but they also come with greater risk.
-   **Liquidity:** The liquidity of an asset refers to how easily it can
    be bought and sold. More liquid assets are easier to trade, as there
    is always a ready market for them.
-   **Correlation:** The correlation between two assets refers to how
    they move in relation to each other. Assets that are positively
    correlated tend to move in the same direction, while assets that are
    negatively correlated tend to move in opposite directions.

### 2. Selecting a trading strategy

Once you have chosen an asset, you need to select a trading strategy.
There are many different trading strategies that you can use on Quotex,
but some of the most popular include:

-   **Moving Average Crossover:** This strategy is based on the moving
    average indicator. The moving average is a technical indicator that
    shows the average price of an asset over a specified period of time.
    When the price of an asset crosses above or below the moving
    average, it can signal a trading opportunity.
-   **Bollinger Bands:** Bollinger Bands are another технический
    индикатор that can be used to identify trading opportunities.
    Bollinger Bands consist of two lines, an upper line and a lower
    line. When the price of an asset moves outside of the Bollinger
    Bands, it can signal a trading opportunity.
-   **Relative Strength Index:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a
    technical indicator that measures the strength of a trend. The RSI
    is a value between 0 and 100. When the RSI is above 70, it indicates
    that the asset is overbought and may be due for a correction. When
    the RSI is below 30, it indicates that the asset is oversold and may
    be due for a rally.

### 3. Placing a trade

Once you have selected a trading strategy, you can place a trade. Simply
enter the amount you want to invest, select the expiration time, and
click on the "Buy" or "Sell" button.

The expiration time is the time at which the trade will expire. You can
choose expiration times from 1 minute to 1 month. The shorter the
expiration time, the higher the risk of the trade. However, the shorter
the expiration time, the higher the potential profit.
